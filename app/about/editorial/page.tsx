          <p className="text-slate-gray leading-relaxed">
            Hushku exists to make pet ownership simpler, healthier, and more joyful. Every article, tool, and guide we publish is built around one question: <strong className="text-ebony">does this genuinely help a pet owner make a better decision?</strong> We do not publish content solely for traffic. If we can&apos;t add something useful, we don&apos;t publish it.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-black text-ebony mb-4">Who We Are</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-gray leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Hushku was founded by two pet owners — Faizan (German Shepherds Zeus and Titan) and Faisal (Husky Nova). Our editorial team combines lived experience as pet parents with research grounded in peer-reviewed veterinary science and guidelines from leading animal health organisations.

We link to our primary sources wherever possible." },
