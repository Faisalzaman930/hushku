    intro: `When couples separate, roommates part ways, or co-owners disagree about a pet's living arrangements, a written pet custody agreement prevents confusion, conflict, and expensive legal disputes. While pets are legally classified as personal property in most U.S. states, courts increasingly recognise the emotional bonds involved — and a signed agreement gives both parties clear, enforceable terms without going to court.

This free template covers every clause a complete pet custody agreement should include. It's written in plain language that non-lawyers can actually read and understand. Download it, fill in the highlighted fields, and both parties sign. For complex disputes involving significant assets or prior conflict, consult a family law attorney who handles pet custody — it's an increasingly specialised area.`,

    faqs: [
      { q: "Is a pet custody agreement legally binding?", a: "Yes — as a civil contract between two parties, it is legally enforceable. Courts treat it like any other property agreement. For it to be held up, both parties must have signed voluntarily, the terms must be clear, and it must not violate state law. Having it notarised strengthens its enforceability." },
      { q: "What if my ex refuses to follow the agreement?", a: "You can take the matter to small claims court (for financial disputes under your state's limit) or file a civil lawsuit for breach of contract. In states like California where courts consider the pet's best interest, you may also request a modified custody order through family court." },
      { q: "Do I need a lawyer to write a pet custody agreement?", a: "Not for a straightforward shared-care arrangement between two cooperative parties. This template covers all standard clauses. If your situation involves significant assets, prior restraining orders, or contested ownership, consult a family law attorney." },
      { q: "Can this template be used for cats, rabbits, birds, or other pets?", a: "Yes. The template works for any domesticated pet. Simply fill in the correct species and breed information in Section 1. Note that some states have specific regulations for certain exotic animals — verify ownership legality separately." },

    intro: `Every vet visit, vaccination, medication, and health event in your pet's life is a data point.

      { q: "Do I need a new contract for every client as a pet sitter?", a: "Yes — or at minimum a new signed service agreement form for each booking period. Some sitters use a master contract with a supplemental booking form for each new visit. Either approach is fine as long as the key terms (services, dates, rates, emergency authorisation) are documented and signed for each engagement." },
      { q: "What if the pet sitter is a friend — do I still need a contract?", a: "Yes. Informal arrangements are the most common source of disputes. Even a simple signed agreement prevents misunderstandings about payment, what's expected, and who's responsible if something goes wrong. Protect the friendship by being clear in writing." },
      { q: "Should the contract mention pet insurance?", a: "If the pet has insurance, include the policy number and insurer in Section 1 so the sitter can reference it in an emergency. If the sitter has professional liability insurance, they should include their policy details in their header." },
      { q: "What's a reasonable emergency spending limit?", a: "Most owners set this between $200 and $500 — enough to cover an emergency consultation and basic stabilising treatment without requiring the sitter to spend beyond their means. For pets with known health conditions, a higher limit may be appropriate." },

      { q: "What is a no-rehome clause and is it enforceable?", a: "A no-rehome clause requires the adopter to return the pet to the rescue rather than rehoming or surrendering it independently. These clauses are generally enforceable as contract terms. Courts have ruled in rescues' favour in cases where adopters violated them, particularly when the rescue sought to reclaim the animal from unsafe or neglectful situations." },
      { q: "Can a rescue legally take back an adopted pet?", a: "Yes, if the adoption contract includes a reclaim provision that the adopter signed. The rescue must typically give written notice and an opportunity to remedy the issue first, unless the animal's welfare is in immediate danger. Consult a local attorney if you need to invoke this clause." },
      { q: "Do private individuals rehoming a pet need a contract?", a: "It's strongly recommended. Even for a single litter rehoming, a signed contract creates a paper trail, confirms the adopter's commitments, and provides a return path if the placement doesn't work. It also protects you from liability if the animal causes injury after placement." },

Non-core vaccines like Bordetella may require annual or biannual boosters depending on exposure. Always follow your vet's recommendation — AAHA publishes updated vaccination guidelines every few years." },

    quickAnswer: "A pet adoption application is the first screening tool rescues use before committing to a home visit or approval. A good application captures household composition, living situation, experience with pets, references, and the applicant's expectations — giving you enough to pre-screen before investing time in a deeper conversation.",
    intro: `The adoption application is the first line of defence in responsible pet placement. Done well, it screens out obviously unsuitable matches early, gives you a paper trail if a placement goes wrong, and shows serious applicants that your rescue operates professionally.

Done poorly — a form that's too short to be useful, or so long that good adopters give up — it actively works against you. This template hits the right balance: comprehensive enough to surface red flags, short enough that motivated adopters complete it in under ten minutes.

The form covers six areas: contact details, household, living situation, current and past pets, experience and lifestyle, and references. A notes section at the end lets applicants explain anything unusual. Use it as a starting point and customise the questions to your organisation's specific criteria.`,

    faqs: [
      {
        q: "How long should a pet adoption application be?",
        a: "Long enough to surface red flags, short enough that motivated adopters complete it willingly. The sweet spot is 2–3 pages covering the six areas above. If your application takes more than 10 minutes, completion rates drop. A shorter pre-screening call can supplement rather than replace a long form.",
      },
      {
        q: "What are the biggest red flags on an adoption application?",
        a: "History of surrendering or rehoming pets without a clear reason, no prior vet relationship, renting without landlord permission, children under 5 for certain animal types (breed-dependent), hours alone exceeding 8–10 hours daily for dogs, no fenced yard for high-energy breeds, and evasive answers about what happens if they can no longer keep the pet.",
      },
      {
        q: "Should I check all references?",
        a: "Yes — at minimum the vet reference and landlord reference. Personal references are useful but rarely disqualifying on their own (applicants won't list hostile references). The vet reference is the most valuable: a vet who hesitates or gives a lukewarm reference for a prior pet is significant. A non-existent vet reference (claiming prior pets with no vet history) is a red flag.",

      {
        q: "Can I reject an applicant who seems financially unstable?",
        a: "You can factor in the applicant's stated ability to provide veterinary care as a pet welfare consideration — but asking for income documentation or employment verification is sensitive territory. Most rescues ask the open-ended question 'What would you do if the pet required expensive treatment?' and evaluate the response qualitatively.",

An official health certificate (USDA APHIS Form 7001 or equivalent) is a separate, vet-issued legal document required for international and some interstate travel, and cannot be self-issued.",
    intro: `Travelling with a pet involves two distinct documents that are frequently confused:

**1. The personal pet passport** — a consolidated record of your pet's ID, microchip number, vaccinations, vet contacts, and entry requirements for your destination. This is a personal organisational tool, not a legal document. You can create and print it yourself using this template.

**2. The official health certificate** — a legally required document signed and issued by a licensed veterinarian, often endorsed by your national or state veterinary authority (USDA APHIS in the U.S.). This cannot be self-issued. It has strict validity windows (typically 10 days from issuance for international travel). You must book a vet appointment specifically to obtain one before each trip.

This page covers both: a template for your personal pet passport, a guide to what the official health certificate must contain, and country-specific requirements for the most common destinations.`,

UK entry requires an Animal Health Certificate (AHC) issued by an Official Veterinarian within 10 days of travel.\n\n**Microchip standard:** The U.S. uses 15-digit ISO 11784/11785 microchips. If your pet has an older 9-digit or 10-digit chip, bring your own universal scanner when travelling internationally, as some foreign scanners may not read non-ISO chips.`,

        q: "Can I make my own pet passport?",
        a: "Yes — as a personal organisational document, you can create and print your own pet passport using this template. However, the official EU Pet Passport (a government-issued blue booklet) and official health certificates must be issued by a licensed veterinarian and, for international travel, endorsed by the relevant government authority. The personal passport template here complements those official documents — it doesn't replace them.",

      {
        q: "How far in advance do I need to prepare to travel internationally with my pet?",
        a: "It depends on the destination. For most of Europe: 3–4 weeks minimum (rabies vaccine needs 21-day wait after titre test). For the UK specifically: add an additional appointment for tapeworm treatment within 24–120 hours of arrival. For Australia, New Zealand, or Japan: 6 months minimum — these countries have strict quarantine protocols and lengthy preparation timelines. Always check the official government website of your destination country, as requirements change.",

        q: "What is a USDA APHIS-accredited vet and do I need one?",
        a: "For international travel from the U.S., your health certificate must be signed by a USDA-accredited veterinarian (not just any licensed vet). Most general practice vets are USDA-accredited — ask specifically when booking. The certificate then needs to be endorsed by your regional USDA APHIS office, which typically takes 1–5 business days. Factor this into your planning.",

        a: "If your pet has an older non-ISO chip (common in dogs chipped before 2014 in the U.S.), bring a universal microchip scanner when travelling to ensure it can be read. Some countries require ISO-standard chips as a condition of entry — check your specific destination. You can have a second ISO-compliant chip implanted alongside the existing one.",

    intro: `The difference between a lost pet flyer that generates tips and one that doesn't comes down to three things: photo quality, phone number size, and where it's posted.

Most lost pet flyers fail because owners try to include too much information. A person driving past a telephone pole has 1–2 seconds to register your flyer. In that time, they can process: the animal's face, the word LOST, and a phone number. That's it.

    stateNotes: `**Microchip first:** Before posting flyers, call your microchip registry (HomeAgain, PetLink, AKC Reunite) and mark your pet as missing. Also call every shelter, rescue, and vet clinic within 10 miles — phone calls beat flyers for shelter reunions because staff may not check online registries. File a report at PetFBI.org and NextDoor.\n\n**Flyer placement:** Telephone poles, community notice boards, pet store windows, vet clinic boards, dog park entrances, and the entrance/exit of any grocery store within 1 mile. Aim for 50–100 flyers posted within the first 6 hours. Laminate at high-value locations (park entrances) to weather-proof them.`,

      {
        q: "Should I include the reward amount on the flyer?",
        a: "No. 'Reward offered' is enough — it motivates people without anchoring to a specific amount. Listing a large amount can attract dishonest responses or theft attempts. Listing a small amount can reduce motivation. Let callers know the amount when they phone.",
      },
      {
        q: "What size should I print the flyers?",
        a: "Standard letter (8.5x11) or A4 for general posting. Print a few in A3/tabloid (11x17) for high-traffic spots — park entrances, community boards, grocery store entrances. Larger format = visible from further away. Always print in colour; black and white significantly reduces recognisability.",
      },
      {
        q: "My pet is shy and won't approach strangers. What should I say on the flyer?",
        a: "Include a clear note: 'Very shy — please do NOT approach or chase. Call us immediately with the location.' A frightened pet will run from strangers attempting to catch them, and a tip about location is far more valuable than a failed catch attempt. Also mention any food they respond to (e.g., 'will come for cheese').",

      {
        q: "How is this different from the Lost Pet Poster template?",
        a: "This page focuses on two flyer formats — a print version optimised for telephone pole posting and a digital/social version optimised for sharing online. The Lost Pet Poster template is a longer-format document with more fields for detailed information. Use this flyer for rapid deployment in the first hours; use the poster for more complete information at community boards and vet clinics.",
