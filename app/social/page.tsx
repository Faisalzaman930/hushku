const faqs = [
  { q: "How is Hushku's social feed different from Instagram or TikTok?", a: "The key difference is the neighborhood-first algorithm. Instagram and TikTok prioritize content from accounts with large followings regardless of location. Hushku's feed is radius-based — you see the pets that live near you first. This means your engagement builds a local community you can actually interact with in real life, not just online." },
  { q: "Is there a public or private option for pet profiles?", a: "Yes. You can set your pet's profile to fully public (visible to anyone on the platform), local-only (visible only to users within your chosen radius), or friends-only (visible only to accounts you follow back). Your personal information is always separate from your pet's public profile." },
  { q: "Are there breed-specific groups?", a: "Yes. Hushku has groups for hundreds of breeds as well as mix-type groups (e.g., 'Doodle Mixes', 'Rescue Mutts'). Groups include discussion boards, photo sharing, health Q&As, and member-organized local meetups. Any user can request a new group if their breed isn't listed." },
  { q: "Can I sell pet products on the social feed?", a: "Not currently. The social feed is community-first — no vendor listings, no sponsored posts, no selling in the feed. A marketplace feature is in development for a future app update, but it will be a separate section rather than integrated into the social feed to keep it clean." },
  { q: "What content moderation does Hushku have?", a: "All posts go through automated content filtering for prohibited material (animal cruelty, graphic content, spam). Users can report any post or profile. Verified moderators review reports within 24 hours. Accounts with multiple verified reports are suspended pending review. Verified users have stricter accountability than unverified ones." },
